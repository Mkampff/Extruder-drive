These are the all the printed parts for the extruder for a RepRapPro Mendel or
Huxley.  See:

    http://reprappro.com/Tricolour_Mendel
    http://reprappro.com/Mono_Mendel
    http://reprappro.com/Huxley

Each filename has the number-off for that part that you need to print as part of 
its filename.

For a Tricolour Mendel you will need three extruder drives.  For a Mono Mendel or a Huxley 
you will need one extruder drive.

For all the other printed parts for the machines see here:

    https://github.com/reprappro/Mendel
    https://github.com/reprappro/Huxley

For complete build instructions for the machines and lists of the non-printed parts you
will also need, see here:

    http://reprappro.com/wiki/index.php/RepRapPro_Tricolour
    http://reprappro.com/wiki/index.php/RepRapPro_Huxley

(The Mono Mendel has the same instructions as the Tricolour.)

RepRapPro sells hardware-only kits to go with the printed parts described above so that
you can print your own RepRap and then get all the additional hardware needed to build
and operate the complete machine from one place.  See the first three links above for details.
